    I am a data scientist with hands-on experience building machine learning and NLP models, designing scalable data workflows, and turning complex data into actionable insights. 
    My interests include machine learning, network analysis, natural language processing, and geospatial data. \\
    My recent work has involved building topic models and LLM-based pipelines for large-scale text data, as well as developing reproducible data workflows for interdisciplinary projects. \\
